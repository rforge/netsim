## Use the R_HOME indirection to support installations of multiple R version

## inspired by RSiena Makevars file
PKG_LIBS = `$(R_HOME)/bin/Rscript -e "Rcpp:::LdFlags()"`
## RInstanceFactory is not included in packages
SOURCES = $(wildcard attribute/*.cpp model/*.cpp model/*/*.cpp network/*.cpp processstate/*.cpp simulator/*.cpp utils/Random.cpp rwrapper/*.cpp)
OBJECTS = *.o $(SOURCES:.cpp=.o)

# added because of r-forge compilation problem
# PKG_CPPFLAGS= -idirafter`$(R_HOME)/bin/Rscript -e "Rcpp:::LdFlags()"`
# PKG_CPPFLAGS= -I${R_HOME}/include -I.

## As an alternative, one can also add this code in a file 'configure'
##
##    PKG_LIBS=`${R_HOME}/bin/Rscript -e "Rcpp:::LdFlags()"`
## 
##    sed -e "s|@PKG_LIBS@|${PKG_LIBS}|" \
##        src/Makevars.in > src/Makevars
## 
## which together with the following file 'src/Makevars.in'
##
##    PKG_LIBS = @PKG_LIBS@
##
## can be used to create src/Makevars dynamically. This scheme is more
## powerful and can be expanded to also check for and link with other
## libraries.  It should be complemented by a file 'cleanup'
##
##    rm src/Makevars
##
## which removes the autogenerated file src/Makevars. 
##
## Of course, autoconf can also be used to write configure files. This is
## done by a number of packages, but recommended only for more advanced users
## comfortable with autoconf and its related tools.
